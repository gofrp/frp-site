      <description>Encryption and Compression Note: When TLS is enabled between frpc and frps, traffic will be globally encrypted, and encryption on individual proxies is no longer needed. This is enabled by default in newer versions.&#xA;Each proxy can choose whether to enable encryption and compression features.&#xA;The encryption algorithm uses aes-128-cfb, and the compression algorithm uses snappy.&#xA;Specify in each proxy&amp;rsquo;s configuration using the following parameters:&#xA;[[proxies]] name = &amp;#34;ssh&amp;#34; type = &amp;#34;tcp&amp;#34; localPort = 22 remotePort = 6000 transport.</description>

      <title>Custom TLS Protocol Encryption</title>

      <description>transport.useEncryption and STCP functions can effectively prevent traffic content from being stolen during communication, but cannot determine whether the other party&amp;rsquo;s identity is legitimate, posing a risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. For this reason, frp supports traffic encryption between frpc and frps through TLS protocol, and supports client or server unidirectional verification, bidirectional verification, and other functions.&#xA;When transport.tls.force = true in frps.toml, it means the server only accepts TLS connection clients, which is also a prerequisite for frps to verify frpc identity.</description>
